# Readme
The purpose of this code is to search through a directory (and subdirectories) and extract all file metadata.

## Work done so far
* Run the example in the \example folder to see the metadata extracted by Tika (works on Windows/Linux).
* Run the main program file_cleanup.py (works on Linux only).

## To do
* Expand this Readme to give more context
* Update main file file_cleanup.py to also work on Windows.
